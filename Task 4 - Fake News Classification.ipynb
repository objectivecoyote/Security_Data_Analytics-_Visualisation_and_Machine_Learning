    "The completion of this worksheet is worth **30%** towards your portfolio for the UFCFEL-15-3 Security Data Analytics and Visualisation (SDAV) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will need to develop a system that can perform text analytics to classify news articles as either being fake news or true. You should look to use the ***ski-kit learn*** Python library as part of your work - you will find it useful to conduct research and to examine the user guide: [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "The provided dataset has two csv files: one contains 23481 fake news articles, the other contains 21417 true news articles. The data consists of the following columns: title (contains news headlines), text (contains news content/article), subject (type of news), and date (date the news was published).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to consider how to pre-process the data so that it is suitable for further analysis and for use with a machine learning classifier. This will include how the data is structured, how the output class is denoted, any cleansing of the text that may be required (e.g., removal of stopwords, stemming, n-grams).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should then show how you can deploy 3 different ML classifiers on the data, using the scikit-learn library to achieve this. As an example, you may choose the following 3 algorithms (or you may explore suitable alternatives):\n",
    "\n",
    "- logreg_cv = LogisticRegression(random_state=0)\n",
    "- dt_cv=DecisionTreeClassifier()\n",
    "- nb_cv=MultinomialNB(alpha=0.1) \n",
    "\n",
    "You should make use of visualisation to illustrate the distinguishing characteristics of the dataset classes, including the news categories and the top 20 n-grams of the data in each respective class.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to describe the analytical process you have taken using Markdown, and you will need to report your overall final accuracy for the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment and Marking\n",

    "Your submission should include:\n",
    "- HTML export of your complete assignment in notebook format.\n",
    "- Original ipynb source file of your notebook.\n",

    "### Self-Assessment\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "For each criteria, please reflect on the marking rubric and indicate what grade you would expect to receive for the work that you are submitting. For your own personal development and learning, it is important to reflect on your work and to attempt to assess this careful. Do think carefully about both positive aspects of your work, as well as any limitations you may have faced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Suitable use of text pre-processing (30%)**: You estimate that your grade will be 80.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use of 3 Machine Learning classifiers and reporting their performance (30%)**: You estimate that your grade will be 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualisation techniques to understand the pre-processing and classification stages (20%)**: You estimate that your grade will be 80.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clarity and professional presentation (20%)**: You estimate that your grade will be 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please provide a minimum of two sentences to comment and reflect on your own self-assessment:\n",
    "\n",
    "*I feel I did well on the text pre-processing, however I think I should have used the news categories instead of just dropping the column. I later realised a big portion of the top n-grams were politics related, and so I could have perhaps made use of this.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*I used 3 different machine learning algorithms and I reported their performance with regards to different metrics (e.g. recall, precision). I also made a confusion matrix for each so I think I met this criteria extremely well.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*As for the visualisation techniques, I think I could have included one or two more in order to show the pre-rocessing stages. My only visualisation was the ratio between true and false news sources, but I could have perhaps included another.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally for the clarity and professioanl presentation, I think I did well and made good use of markup, headings, subheadings and so on so that it was clear what I was doing at each stage.*"

       "'On Christmas day, Donald Trump announced that he would  be back to work  the following day, but he is golfing for the fourth day in a row. The former reality show star blasted former President Barack Obama for playing golf and now Trump is on track to outpace the number of golf games his predecessor played.Updated my tracker of Trump s appearances at Trump properties.71 rounds of golf including today s. At this pace, he ll pass Obama s first-term total by July 24 next year. https://t.co/Fg7VacxRtJ pic.twitter.com/5gEMcjQTbH  Philip Bump (@pbump) December 29, 2017 That makes what a Washington Post reporter discovered on Trump s website really weird, but everything about this administration is bizarre AF. The coding contained a reference to Obama and golf:  Unlike Obama, we are working to fix the problem   and not on the golf course.  However, the coding wasn t done correctly.The website of Donald Trump, who has spent several days in a row at the golf course, is coded to serve up the following message in the event of an internal server error: https://t.co/zrWpyMXRcz pic.twitter.com/wiQSQNNzw0  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017That snippet of code appears to be on all https://t.co/dkhw0AlHB4 pages, which the footer says is paid for by the RNC? pic.twitter.com/oaZDT126B3  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017It s also all over https://t.co/ayBlGmk65Z. As others have noted in this thread, this is weird code and it s not clear it would ever actually display, but who knows.  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017After the coding was called out, the reference to Obama was deleted.UPDATE: The golf error message has been removed from the Trump and GOP websites. They also fixed the javascript  =  vs  ==  problem. Still not clear when these messages would actually display, since the actual 404 (and presumably 500) page displays a different message pic.twitter.com/Z7dmyQ5smy  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 29, 2017That suggests someone at either RNC or the Trump admin is sensitive enough to Trump s golf problem to make this issue go away quickly once people noticed. You have no idea how much I d love to see the email exchange that led us here.

    "It is clear from this that the Decision Tree classifier comes out on top with regards to Accuracy and Recall, as well as overall Accuracy.

    "SVM appears to be making many more False Positive predictions, meanwhile it makes comparatively few (almost half as many) False Negative predictions making it more one sided.\n",

    "A similar pattern is seen with the Decision Tree model, where it seems to be making more False Positive predictions than False Negative predictions. Although it would be more ideal that there was an even number of incorrect predictions (as this would mean the accuracy score is more reliable), the difference is small and so it can safely be said that the Decision Tree model is the best.\n",
